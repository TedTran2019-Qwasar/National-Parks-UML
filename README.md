# National-Parks-UML
UML for an imaginary national park system

I used diagrams.net to quickly make a diagram of how I'd imagine the classes would connect with other. Since more information wasn't given on what the project would be, I decided to omit admin/user and kept all instance variables/methods public. Hmm, I should read more about OOP design.
